Shad CN uui has been taking over the web
dev industry and with this new release
it #39;s looking like it #39;s going to get even
further I am so hyped with all the work
shad and crew have been putting into
this project and I am really hyped about
what they #39;ve just added I #39;m already a
pretty big user and if you want to hear
more about why I #39;m so hyped on Shad let
me know in the comments and I #39;ll be sure
to make that video soon but for now I
just want to talk about what #39;s changing
because there #39;s some really cool stuff
in this release without further Ado
let #39;s take a look the latest Shaden
release the main exciting thing in this
release since they #39;re a component
library is the new components and
there #39;s some really cool elaborate stuff
here first we have a carousel yes
finally a carousel as part of Shad UI
this is really exciting stuff to finally
have and as per always this isn #39;t a
library you install and depend on a
bunch of dependencies of this is source
code that you can copy and it #39;s really
nice they give you all of the source
code and the react stuff you need in
order to build this correctly and that
when you add it to your app it works as
you expect it #39;s built on top of the
embla carousel which is a lightweight
Carousel library with fluid motion and
great swipe Precision that #39;s dope cuz
that means it will work well on mobile
too and again like you could go build
this yourself and I #39;m sure a lot of
people will and many of them probably
should but there are really good
standardized solutions for so many
problems from all the weird
accessibility stuff radx does to all the
weird touch behaviors that emble
Carousel probably does having Shad
standardized all of these with reusable
components that live in your codebase
not this Library gives you both the
benefits of these standards and the
flexibility of having your own
components they also added a drawer the
drawer is super compelling as well
making a good drawer component that
slides up at the bottom that is the
right behaviors on mobile where you can
slide it down when it #39;s done and it
feels good with these big cancel and
submit buttons all handling like page
layout sizing and properly is
obnoxious look at how smooth that is
that #39;s dope good stuff very exciting
they also have pagination which crazy
enough they didn #39;t have before
previously you would have to Define
these things yourself I know I #39;ve had to
build a lot of pagination components in
my time and it #39;s really nice to see
someone build a generic that I don #39;t
have to worry about anymore kind of
funny that when I clicked that it just
brought me to top of the page but really
nice that they #39;ve built proper
pagination all necessary behaviors as
well as letting you bring in your own
link components when you use it really
really cool stuff dope to see we also
have a resizable and I have feelings
because doing rizab ility properly and
react is a thing I have a lot of
experience with if you haven #39;t already
watched my video about the coolest
project I ever built the vast majority
of that project was making good
resizable behaviors with drag and drop
on top of it inside of react I #39;ll
quickly show you this is mod view this
is one of the most absurd drag and drop
experiences I know of in modern web this
whole UI is customizable I can hide the
sidebar I can move things different
places resize them grab things from the
sidebar move things to the sidebar drag
them around the sidebar and getting all
of these behaviors correct was
incredibly difficult but as a result we
built an awesome user experience that as
far as I #39;m concerned hasn #39;t been taught
by any moderation tools to date we built
this because moderators have a lot of
needs and we needed to solve those as
best we could the library we build a lot
of this with react Mosaic I had to fork
and build a ton of stuff on top of to
make this work at all and now is just a
component that #39;s built into Shad UI that
does most of this work for you and again
the code is there for you to grab as you
need it this default UI resizable bit is
in your own code base you have the
ability to use it however you want
change it however you need and build
something really really cool and it #39;s
all built on top of react resizable
panels by Brian vau who is an absolute
Legend mostly known for building the
react Dev tools Chrome extension now
he #39;s at replay helping build really deep
developer tools for react wonderful Dude
incredibly talented engineer he built
one of the best ways to do resizable
panels and now there #39;s an abstraction as
part of Shad UI super dope and now we
have sonor I don #39;t quite know what sonor
is but what I do know is it #39;s really
good toast notifications so if I click
this we get this really fancy nice slow
popup of the toast with good behaviors
for hiding it and getting rid of it you
even see this button has an onclick for
toast event has been created description
action label onclick all of those things
really good stuff a lot of these
behaviors that are hard to get right
especially once you #39;re dealing with
mobile have been solved oh open multiple
oh okay I see why you said to do that do
you see how good that
looks oh
God yeah that #39;s really good I #39;m
sorry I did not expect that to be that
good but again that this is the benefit
of shad youi and the whole Shad CM
package is all of these things are done
well Tastefully and corre irly they
don #39;t have much personality that #39;s the
big thing you #39;re missing here if you
want a website that stands out this
isn #39;t the way to do that but this is all
of the pieces you need to make something
great and I you have no idea how hard it
is to build these things correctly
unless you #39;ve done it having this all as
part of something you can just npm
install is incredible also of note you
just watched it in a 30 FPS video it
looks really good on this 120 FPS screen
enough about the components cuz they
also did some pretty big changes to the
CLI I think the CLI was an incredible
addition to Shad CN because previously
you would copy paste the component into
your codebase yourself once v0 is
introduced which if you #39;re not already
familiar I have a whole video about it
it #39;s vel #39;s AI generation for components
this need to have a good way for you to
have all the necessary files from Shad
CN UI when you make something so like if
I click on an example here you #39;ll see in
the code a lot of the stuff here is
coming from @/ component UI these are
all Shad UI things now that there #39;s a
CLI and that can be called and included
as part of the v0 command they #39;re able
to generate any of the missing pieces
that you might not have in your code
base yet but again these are in your
code base these aren #39;t packages being
imported it #39;s a CLI running to create
the files necessary in your code base so
you still own it and I think it #39;s really
cool they made that a CLI so now you can
install and add specific components that
you #39;re missing without having to copy
paste a bunch of different code it also
allows for these components have
different levels of complexity different
levels of importing behaviors and all
done properly with just running a
command the CLI was not the best
experience when I tried it it made some
assumptions about where things were that
were incorrect I think it can do that
better with inference but at the time it
was still revolutionary and I #39;m really
excited to see how it iterates so let #39;s
see what they #39;ve added you can now
configure a custom Tailwind prefix and
the CLI will automatically prefix your
utility classes that #39;s really nice so if
you only want Tailwind for these things
or if you want to integrate it with
something else like docusaurus or nextra
it #39;s much easier to do that if you can
automatically apply a prefix to all of
the things that you need the CI can now
also detect tailin config TS which is
nice cuz a lot of these things miss the
fact that your tailin file might be in
typescript they fix that and they also
add the Tex version of the config good
stuff this is a huge update and I am
genuinely really hyped I #39;ll be using a
lot of these components for a lot of
different things and unlike other things
when they update we don #39;t have to go and
refactor a bunch of stuff or install
this new package and deal with a bunch
of breaking things the change is there
are now additional components you can
use and that #39;s really cool because Shad
CN UI isn #39;t your traditional Library
it #39;s a pile of components to help you
get started and build better
applications faster you want to hear
more about why I think Shad CN UI is so
cool and different let me know in the
comments I #39;ll do a whole dedicated video
about it soon but for now want you to
see these updates because I am really
hyped thank you guys as always if you
want to hear me talk about CSS Mor I #39;ll
pin that video in the corner here good
to see you as always I #39;ll see you in the
next one peace NS
